Project Description

The Archivo is a niche video game catalog website designed to archive and display an extensive collection of games from past and present generations. It provides details such as platform availability (physical, digital, or shutdown), developer information, genre, and release year. With a dynamic filtering system, users can search for games based on tags, aesthetics, and release periods. The Archivo captures the nostalgic essence of the early 2000s gaming era with retro-inspired design elements and a sleek interface.

Target Audience

The Archivo primarily targets gamers aged 10–18+ who appreciate the culture and aesthetics of the 1990s–2010s gaming era. The site’s design aims to evoke nostalgia through minimalistic, PlayStation-inspired visuals, bold typography, and a futuristic-retro color palette. It appeals to both collectors and casual gamers interested in exploring obscure or discontinued titles. 

Market Research 

Market Research Similar platforms include Backloggd, VGCollect, and GGApp.io. While these sites focus on general cataloging or collection tracking, The Archivo differentiates itself through its aesthetic direction, emphasis on defunct or hard-to-find titles, and its community-driven review and discussion features.
